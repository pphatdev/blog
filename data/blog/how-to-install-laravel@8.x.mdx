Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)  can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). In addition, we recommend [installing Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/).


After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer` create-project` command:

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel:^8.* laravel-app
```

Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:


```
composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app
```

After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI `serve` command:

```
cd example-app
 
php artisan serve
```

Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
